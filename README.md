## üìÅ Project Structure

Each folder contains a self-contained notebook (or notebooks) exploring a specific concept:

- **01-gates-and-basics/**  
  Explore basic gates, superposition, entanglement, and interference using circuit simulations and Bloch sphere visualizations.

- **02-deutsch-bernstein/**  
  Implement the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms to understand quantum advantage in function evaluation.

- **03-grover/**  
  Use Grover‚Äôs algorithm to search unstructured databases and experiment with custom oracles (like Sudoku constraints).

- **04-vqe-simulation/**  
  Simulate simple molecules like H‚ÇÇ using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to explore quantum chemistry with Qiskit Nature.

- **05-error-correction/**  
  Understand noise and how basic error correction (like the 3-qubit repetition code) protects quantum information.
